## About The Project
This application is computer reproduction of the classic pattern-matching game, ** Simon **. The game creates a series of lights and tones that requires the user to reproduce the sequence immediately after it is presented. If the player succeeds, the sequence gets longer by one until a max series of 20. If the user fails, one of two things can happen: if the strict mode is activated, Simon presents the player with double exclamation points and the user has to start all over with a new sequence. If strict mode is off, the user is again presented with double exclamation points, indicating failure, however, the sequence continues.
